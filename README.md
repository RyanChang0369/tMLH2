# tMLH2
tModLoader Helper 2 is a useful little program that aims to help you develop sprites with tModLoader without having to reload the game. Currently, it supports armor only. More functionality will be added in the future. 

## Features

- Real-time updating of images allows you to work with another image editing program and see your changes instantly being reflected in tMLH2.
- Basic image editing allows you to make basic changes to sprites.
- Frame-by-frame viewing allows you to view each frame of the sprites individually.
- Layers allow you to view multiple items at once, and it allows you to view and edit entire sets of armor at once.
- Smart detection tries to detects the type of item from its .cs page and adjust the rendering of the item accordingly.
